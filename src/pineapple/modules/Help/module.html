                    Unlike traditional War Driving, whereby the auditor passively listens for beacons being advertised by Access Points to paint a picture of the surrounding WiFi landscape, the WiFi Pineapple Recon goes one giant step further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By monitoring channels for both beacons and data activity, Recon paints a more complete picture by combining Access Points with their respective clients. With the WiFi landscape displayed in this manner, a tester can quickly identify potential targets from Recon and immediately take action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recon allows the auditor to scan for nearby Access Points and Clients. Clients are identified by sniffing for active traffic and are displayed 
underneath their 
parent Access Point. If a Client is associated to an Access Point but idle, it may not appear in the list. Increasing scan duration from the drop-down allows the sniffer to see more potential traffic on each channel. Clients or Access Points that appear in blue have MAC addresses that are locally assigned to the corresponding device. This could be an indication of MAC randomization or spoofing, but also appears when a vendor assigns MACs that are not registered with the IEEE Registration Authority. Italicized MACs have saved information from the Notes module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SSID, MAC, Security, Channel and Signal of Access Points are displayed in the table view. Clients are listed as MAC addresses only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking the menu button next to an MAC address shows a menu providing buttons to add or remove the MAC from the PineAP Filter or PineAP Tracking feature. Opening this menu will automatically look up the MAC address in the OUI database if it has been downloaded. In order to download the OUI database, either the WiFi Pineapple or the web browser itself must have internet access. Deauth uses the multiplier to send multiple deauthentication frames to the target Client. A multiplier of 2 is twice as many deauthentication frames as a multiplier of 1. The menu button is disabled when a scan is active (ie. not stopped or paused).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking the menu button next to an SSID shows a menu providing buttons to add or remove the SSID from the PineAP Pool or PineAP Filter. Deauth Clients will send deauthentication frames to all associated clients currently recognized by Recon using the multiplier. A multiplier of 2 is twice as many deauthentication frames as a multiplier of 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking the clone feature for enterprise access points copies the data to the PineAP Enterprise feature so that the access point can be impersonated to capture clients and credentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unassociated Clients show in a unique table listed by MAC Address. These Clients have active radios, however are not associated to an Access Point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out Of Range Clients will display in a unique table along with their relationship to their parent Access Point by MAC address only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the scan duration is set to Continuous, the scan will run indefinitely until it is stopped by the user. Checking the Live box enables Recon++ and live result streaming. A websocket pushes new scan data to the web interface every five seconds, providing a real time view of the wireless landscape.

                    PineAP is an effective, modular rogue access point suite designed to aid the WiFi auditor in collecting clients by thoroughly mimicking Preferred Networks including Enterprise access points. When acting as an Enterprise access point, it can capture clients and credentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Allow Associations</b> - when enabled, Client devices will be allowed to associate with the WiFi Pineapple through any requested SSID. E.g. If a Client device sends a Probe Request for SSID "example" the WiFi Pineapple will acknowledge the request, respond and allow the Client device to associate and connect to the WiFi Pineapple network. This feature works in conjunction with Client and SSID filtering. Clients attempting to associate to an SSID disallowed by Filters will be unable to associate. Clients with a MAC blocked by Filters will not be able to associate. When disabled, clients will not be allowed to associate. Formerly named Karma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>PineAP Daemon</b> - This daemon must be enabled in order to use the Log PineAP Events, Client Connect Notifications, Client Disconnect Notifications, Beacon Response, Capture SSIDs to Pool and Broadcast SSID pool features. The PineAP Daemon will coordinate the appropriate actions based on Source and Target MAC settings as well as the Beacon Response and SSID Broadcast intervals. This feature requires access to wlan1 and cannot be used in conjunction with WiFi Client Mode if wlan1 is used. PineAP Daemon must be enabled and PineAP Settings must be saved before the associated features will be available.

                <p>
                    <b>Log PineAP Events</b> - when enabled, Client device Probe Requests, Client Associations to, and dissassociations from the WiFi Pineapple will be logged. This feature provides information for analysis from the Logging view. If disabled, Associations will not be logged and may not appear in the SSID column from the Clients view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Client Connect Notifications</b>- when enabled, the WiFi auditor will receive notifications when clients connect to the pineapple.

                <p>
                    <b>Capture SSIDs to Pool</b> - when enabled, the sniffer will save the SSID data of captured Probe Requests to the SSID Pool. This passive feature benefits the Broadcast SSID Pool feature. The SSID Pool may also be managed manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Beacon Response</b> - when enabled, targeted beacons will be transmitted to Client devices in response to a Probe Request with the appropriate SSID. These beacons will not be transmitted to broadcast, but rather specifically to the device making the probe request. This prevents the beacon from being visible to other devices. If Allow Associations is enabled and the Client device associates with the WiFi Pineapple, then targeted Beacon Responses will continue to transmit to the Client device for a period of time. Beacon Responses will use the Source MAC setting, which is also shared with the Broadcast SSID Pool feature.The Beacon Response Interval will dictate how quickly they are transmitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Broadcast SSID Pool</b> - when enabled, the SSID Pool will be broadcasted as beacons using the Source MAC and Target MAC settings at the interval specified. Formerly named Dogma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Broadcast SSID Pool Interval</b> - Specifies the Interval in which to Broadcast SSIDs from the Pool. Aggressive requires more CPU usage while Lower requires less.

                <p>
                    <b>Beacon Response Interval</b> - Specifies the Interval in which to transmit Beacon Responses. Aggressive requires more CPU usage while Lower requires less.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Source MAC</b> - by default, this is the MAC address of wlan0 on the WiFi Pineapple. This is the interface for which associations may be allowed and also hosts the Management Access Point. The MAC address of wlan0 may be changed from the Networking view. This MAC address may be set to that of a secondary WiFi Pineapple if desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Target MAC</b> - by default, this is the broadcast MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Frames transmitted to broadcast will be seen by all nearby Client devices. Setting the Client MAC address will target PineAP features at the single device. Similar to Beacon Response, only SSIDs Broadcast from the Pool will be visible to the targeted Client device. When used in conjunction with Filtering, this feature enables precision device targeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>SSID Pool</b> - populated automatically when the Capture SSID Pool feature is enabled. May also be added to manually using the text field and Add button. Similarly, clicking a listed SSID will populate the text field allowing for the removal of the entry using the Remove button. From the SSID Pool Menu, Download SSID Pool downloads the list of SSIDs in the database and Clear SSID Pool will remove all entries.

                    The tracking feature will continuously scan for specified Clients by MAC address and execute a customizable Tracking Script. This feature requires the Log Probes and/or Log Associations features of PineAP to be enabled. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients may be specified manually using the text field and add button. Clients may also be added to the Client Tracking List by using the PineAP Tracking Add MAC button from an associated MAC address within the Clients view or Recon view. Selecting a MAC address from the Client Tracking List will populate the text field for removal using the Remove button. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a client is identified by a logged Probe or Association, the customizable Tracking Script will execute. The Tracking Script defines variables for the Client MAC address, the identification type (Probe or Association) and the SSID with which the Client is Probing or Associating.

                <p>
                    <b>PineAP Log</b> - chronologically displays PineAP events if Log Probes and/or Log Associations are enabled. Each event contains a timestamp, event type (Probe Request or Association), the MAC address of the Client device, and the SSID for which the device is Probing or Associating.

                <p>
                    <b>PineAP Log Filtering</b><br/>
                    The Display Probes and Display Associations checkboxes enable the auditor to toggle the display of Probes or Associations. The Remove Duplicates checkbox will remove any duplicate entry, regardless of timestamp. For example, if a Client transmits a Probe Request for SSID "example" 10 times in 1 hour, checking the Remove Duplicates box will show only the first entry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filtering by MAC address and SSID is supported by completing the associated text fields. For example, if de:ad:be:ef:c0:fe is input in the MAC text field, only that Client device activity will show in the PineAP Log. MAC and SSID filters also support Regular Expressions. Similarly the Log may be filtered by SSID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filters do not apply until the Apply Filter button is pressed. Clear Filter will reset to the default and display all captured data. Refresh Log will obtain the latest log data from PineAP and Clear Log will empty the Log File. By default PineAP log database is located in /tmp and will not be saved after a reboot.

                <p>
                    <b>WiFi Client Mode</b> - this feature enables the auditor to connect the WiFi Pineapple to another wireless access point for Internet or local network access. When using WiFi Client Mode, the IP routing will automatically update to use the selected interface. The WiFi Pineapple can be used with a number of supported USB WiFi adapters to add a third (wlan2) interface. wlan0 is reserved for use by the Access Point and wlan1 is required by PineAP and cannot be used if the PineAP Daemon and its subsequent features are being used. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To connect to a nearby Access Point, select the desired Interface and click Scan.
